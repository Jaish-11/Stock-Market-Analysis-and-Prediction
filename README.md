A long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model that can analyze real-time stock market data to uncover complex non-linear patterns and make predictive price projections. The model incorporates technical indicators like moving averages alongside past prices to detect signals in the noise of the market. We are training it on historical data from leading indexes and tech stocks.
